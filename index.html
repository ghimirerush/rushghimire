        Welcome! This is my personal website that I have built myself. 
        Here, you can find all the different projects and creations 
        I have designed and the hobbies or pastimes that I am interested in.

       <h2>About the Author</h2>
       <br>
       <p>
        My name is Rushan Ghimire, and I am a current High School student who lives near the nationâ€™s capital, Washington D.C. 
        I love anything mechanical and computer-related, including but not limited to engines and computers. In my free time, 
        I enjoy playing the piano and reading. I also love nature and everything about it, and I am fascinated by cars. 
        I spend a lot of my time searching up new things online, like how I can solve my daily problems, from iPhone troubleshooting to schoolwork.
       </p>
       <br>

       <h2>Creating this Website</h2>
       <br>
       <p>
        I built this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I know, there are easier and far better ways to build web pages and websites. 
        However, this website allowed me to further explore the things I love and share my passion with the world. While programming this website, 
        I grasped a whole lot of new things that could help me later in life, such as coding skills, but I also learned determination and perseverance.
         I went through a lot of ups and downs whilst designing this site, and there were many times when I felt like giving up and dropping the idea. 
         But, I always envisioned a complete, awesome-looking website and the rewarding feeling that would give me, so I kept pushing. 
         It did end up being very rewarding!
